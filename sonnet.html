            <ul>               
                <li> Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</li>
                <li> Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</li>
                <li> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</li>
                <li> And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</li>
                <li> Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
                <li> And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;</li>
                <li> And every fair from fair sometime declines,</li>
                <li> By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;</li>
                <li> But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</li>
                <li> Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</li>
                <li> Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</li>
                <li> Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</li>
                <li> Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</li>
                <li> When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:</li>
                <li> So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</li>
                <li> So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</li>
